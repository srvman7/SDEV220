# 3.1: Multiply seconds in a minute (60) by minutes in an hour (60).
print(60*60)

# 3.2: Assign result from 3.1 to variable called "seconds_per_hour".
seconds_per_hour = 3600

# 3.3: Calculate seconds per day using "seconds_per_hour" variable.
print(seconds_per_hour * 24)

# 3.4: Save result from 3.3 using variable named "seconds_per_day".
hours_per_day = 24
seconds_per_day = seconds_per_hour * hours_per_day

print(seconds_per_day)

# 3.5: Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour using floating-point division.
print(seconds_per_day/seconds_per_hour)

# 3.6: Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour using integer division.
print(seconds_per_day//seconds_per_hour)

# 3.6: Did result from 3.5 agree with result from 3.6?.....
# Answer: Yes.  Both 3.5 and 3.6 results share the same value (24).
